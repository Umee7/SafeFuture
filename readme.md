# 🌱 SafeFuture – AI Safety Principles Website

**SafeFuture** is a clean, minimal, and public-facing website designed to promote essential AI safety principles. It aims to bridge the gap between complex academic discussions and everyday understanding — offering developers and citizens a clear, actionable set of guidelines to help ensure AI is built and used responsibly.

As artificial intelligence continues to evolve and shape our world, it’s more important than ever to make sure it aligns with human values, operates transparently, and remains accountable. **SafeFuture** was created with this belief at its core — to spread awareness, foster responsible AI thinking, and make safety-first principles accessible to all.
